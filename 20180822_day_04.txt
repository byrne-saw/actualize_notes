inheritance is called composition 

module has to be at the top, CamelCase
  a set of conceptual things 

a second way of using modules 

namespacing - creating the box (with module)
  module::class 
  no spaced between :: 

class variable 

a class method must begin with self.

rand(1..100)    -- give a random number from 1 to 100

private  - any method below private within a class is not available outside of the class, but can be called within the class

arguments and parameters are synonymous 

setting a default : def example(purple_hippo, pink_elephant="rupert")
