hash is a list of unique key value pairs (keys are unique) 

" " dynamic
' ' literal characters 

keys can be anything, strings, integers, whatever - most common is symbols
  -symbols take up less memory 
  : at the beginning

Class - models what an object is (attributes)
  - what an object can do / does (behavior)

object.method

question to ask - implicit return, returns the "last line of runnable code"

In a hash, every key is accessible, in a class you can prevent some keys from being accessible
