Getting Unstuck

15 min rule - if you're stuck for more than 15 mins stop and ask

Question Prep:
1) read the error message and find the right error line
2) print (p) your variables right above/right below the error you're getting
3) search online with specific keywords *ruby-doc.org
  -just use the essential words of a question:
    how do i delete an item from an array -> ruby array delete item
4) play with the code - try it out in irb
5) decompose the problem into smaller problems
6) ask for help with a speciifc question

Sublime Settings:
Add the ability to open Sublime from the terminal
Open the terminal and paste this command :

ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl

If there are no error messages, you can now navigate to any folder in the terminal and open it in Sublime using the command subl . in the terminal!

Things that can go wrong:
You may have an error saying you don’t have permission.
In that case, run the same command with sudo in front. It will ask you to enter your password (the one you use to log into your computer)
You may have an error saying subl doesn’t exist.
In that case, you need to properly install Sublime Text 3 in your Applications folder (you may be running it off of your Desktop by accident)
You may have an error saying /usr/local/bin/subl does not exist.
In that case, you need to first make a folder using the command 
sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin.

Configure your Sublime preferences
Open Sublime, then open the user preferences file by clicking on the menu option 
Sublime Text → Preferences → Settings. 
In the file on the right, add the following lines:

"tab_size": 2,
"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
"word_wrap": true,
"save_on_focus_lost": true,
"highlight_modified_tabs": true,
"scroll_past_end": true,

Restart Sublime.

Now Sublime is configured to automatically save your code, tab using two spaces, and word wrap long lines of text. You can research more things to configure with Sublime if you’re interested in further customization!
