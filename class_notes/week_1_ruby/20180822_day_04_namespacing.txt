inheritance is called composition 

module has to be at the top, CamelCase
  a set of conceptual things 

a second way of using modules 

namespacing - creating the box (with module)
  module::class 
  no spaced between :: 

class variable 

a class method must begin with self.

rand(1..100)    -- give a random number from 1 to 100

private  - any method below private within a class is not available outside of the class, but can be called within the class

arguments and parameters are synonymous 

setting a default : def example(purple_hippo, pink_elephant="rupert")

Modules
  -key piece, only for behaviors, not for attributes
  -CamelCase
  -module must come first
  -name should not describe some "thing" - a set of conceptual things - "able" ex Math, "Reportable"
  -method goes into module
  -in the class you want to use a module in, you use: include ModuleName
  -never defined inside a class (might be functionally possible but the idea is to access it outside of a class)
  -only available 

"Mixin" or "Composition" are names for the act of using module. 

def initialize - debate on if the initalizae method should be "mixin", Josh doesn't, would make a class to inherit to do that. 

Modeules are effective when subclasses share behavior that a superclass doesn't have.
