##
separation of concerns
  -modular, in small pieces

MVC - Model View Controller 
  Rails is a MVC framework.
  iPhone apps are MVC

Model = Stored Data
  -Defines how we interact with stored information 
  "It's where we store, and interact with data"
  -ORM = ActiveRecord
      Object Relational Mapping software
    table in database
    class in models folder

View - Interface
  -Defines our interface
  -JSON or HTML
  -Forms
  -other apps, ex: iPhone view is just the part of Swift that appears to the user
  "the visual display, or the interface"

Controller = Logic Flow
  -the leader, analyzing and giving commands
  -combines the pieces together
  -usually involves if statements, filters, or CRUD operations



##

seeds.rb
  -this file runs things in the terminal, and has access to the database
  -data that is local, will not get populated to a server, you need to re-seed the db
  -you can write CRUD operations here
  "a plan ruby file, executed with rake db:seed, that has access to the database"

  ##

Gems 
  - anytime you change your gem file, you need to stop server and run "bundle"
