you can write logic (like an if statement) in a view
  it's not a hard law to keep logic in the controller, but you should really only do it if you're changing the json

puts or p in the controller will print to the terminal


url segment params
  get "/home/:wildcard"
  url segment is any piece in between / /  

: on the routes page define a wild card
: in the url will always break


from params (body params)
  -the only way to send body params is with post, patch, or delete (not get)


use insomnia whenever you need to send non-get requests
