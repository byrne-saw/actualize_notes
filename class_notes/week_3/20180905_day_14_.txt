Active Record Queries
##

What we write in Rails to produce SQL.
Active Record is it's own gem, but was developed with Rails. Typically it would only be used in Rails. 

? will sanitize sql statements to prevent sql injection - it forces a string to replace the ?

select * from recipes order by id asc limit 1;
select * from recipes order by id desc limit 1;

count and length are different methods - count is activerecord, length is ruby

activerecord returns among other things an activerecord relation
