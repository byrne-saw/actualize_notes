Just because something saves in the database, doesn't mean it will stay in the database. It's possible to store longer than 255 characters in a string field, but could be dropped later. 
  Double check that you're storing things as the correct database.

Migration names need to be unique. 

Validations:
  https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html

Ranges: include the first number and last ..
        include the first, but not the last ...

Best practice to do one validation / line - this will throw separate errors for each validation, rather than only one error for a bunch of validations on the same line

Rollback means it was not entered into the database.

Happy path / Sad path
  Happy Path - if everything goes the way we expected it to
  Sad Path - something didn't go the way we want it to go, and we don't want our application to break

Return value of save is a boolean.

  Bonus: How many employees were making over $100,000 a year on June 24, 1992? Return only a number.

      employees e
      join salaries s on e.emp_no = s.emp_no
    where 
      s.salary > 100000 
      and s.from_date <= '19920624'
      and s.to_date >= '19920624'

  Bonus: Repeat exercise #2 without using the LIKE keyword.
    select

    from 
      employees 
    where 
      substring(last_name from 1 for 2) = 'Mi';
