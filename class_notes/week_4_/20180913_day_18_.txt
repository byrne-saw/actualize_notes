worked with richard on big partner exercise 

user object

attributes, what an object IS
behavior, what a object does

if it's a writer, it needs slef.
if it's a reader, it doesn't

before_action :authenticate_user, except: [:index]
before_action :authenticate_user, except: [:index, :create]

i didn't have my helper_method :current_user until we added the authenticate_user
