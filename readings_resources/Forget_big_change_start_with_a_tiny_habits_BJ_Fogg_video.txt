celebrate victory - right away. tell yourself your awesome. 

practice changing your own behavior. 

behavior change is systematic.

long term change, only two ways to get it done:
  1) change your environment (physical, or social) 
  2) automaticity - habits, specifically tiny habits

  relying primarily on motivation or will power to change behavior is a losing strategy

  what causes behavior?
    motivation
    ability
    trigger - call to action

    motivation and ability are trade offs. 

in order to do something difficult you need high levels of motivation. the purpose of motivation is to allow us to do hard things. 

motivation is slippery. if you set yourself up to do something hard and you have to somehow sustain the motivation, the motivation is going to drop down to a point where you won't do it. and habits are about repeating it. 

make the habits really tiny.

how to trigger the behavior. after. the secret is after. - make the trigger an existing behavior. establish what it will come after. 


Formate for a "Tiny Habit"
  After I _______[existing habit]_________,
  I will  _______[new tiny behavior]______.


        plant a tiny seed
        in the right spot
        and it will grow
        without coaxing
